# PasteJacking
Pastejacking  is a technique is a method that malicious websites employ to take control of your computersâ€™ clipboard and change its content to something harmful without your knowledge.
## how  working this scenario  
**The target opens an HTML page served by the tool and this page has anything that makes the user wants to copy from it and paste into the terminal.**
**Target copies anything from the page then in the background it gets replaced quickly with our liner.**
**The user pastes into the terminal and before he notices that the line he copied has been changed :**
    **- The line gets executed by itself in the background (Without pressing enter)**
    **- The terminal gets cleared.**
    **- The user sees the terminal is usable again.**
    **- You already got your meterpreter session by this time.**
**All of that happened in less than second**
